**PRODUCER CONSUMER PROBLEM**

1. Two threads, a producer and a consumer, share a common, fixed size buffer as a queue.
The producer job is to generate data and put it into the buffer, while the consumer's job is to
consume the data from the buffer.
2. The problem is to make sure that the producer won't produce any data if the buffer is full, and the consumer won't
consume any data if the buffer is empty.
